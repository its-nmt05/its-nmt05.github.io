I am passionate about working with generative models such as `World models` and `Diffusion models`. Looking at the current surge of research on world models, I am keen to explore their applications in various fields. I also enjoy working on `computer graphics` and `simulation problems`.

I have expereince in working with generative models from the ground up. I implemented a varational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch inspired by [SD-VAE](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) and trained it on extracted frames from Minecraft gameplay. I also trained a 608 M param Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model on the latent representations from the VAE for high fidelity Minecraft scene generations [[Link]](https://github.com/its-nmt05/DiffuseNet). I have also worked on a U-net based diffusion model based on the ["Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models" (DDPM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) paper. Additionaly, I created [Sim3D](https://github.com/anm-ol/sim3d), which is a 3D physics engine written entirely from scratch in C++ on OpenGL for particle and cloth simulation.

I have previously interned at [Speech and Language Lab, NTU](https://aseschng.github.io/SpeechLab.html) under [Prof. Chng Eng Siong](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00098) and also at [LEAP Lab, IISc Bangalore](http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/) on various audio and speech models.

<!-- My previous work involves working on diffusion models. I implemeneted a DiT based generative model   Meta AI's _ENCODEC_ model from the ["High Fidelity Neural Audio Compression"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13438) paper.
